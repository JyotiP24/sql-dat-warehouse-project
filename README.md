#  SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, covering the entire pipeline from data ingestion to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## 🏛 Data Architecture
The data architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

### 🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- Stores raw data as-is from source systems.
- Data is ingested from **CSV files** into **SQL Server Database**.
- No transformations are applied.

### 🔘 Silver Layer (Processed Data)
- Data undergoes **cleansing, standardization, and normalization**.
- Transformations applied:
  - **Data Cleansing** (handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies)
  - **Data Standardization** (ensuring uniform formats)
  - **Data Normalization** (organizing data for relational integrity)
  - **Derived Columns** (creating new features)
  - **Data Enrichment** (enhancing with additional context)

### 🏆 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- Houses data modeled into a **star schema** optimized for reporting and analytics.
- Transformations applied:
  - **Data Integrations**
  - **Aggregations**
  - **Business Logic Implementations**
- Data models:
  - **Star Schema**
  - **Flat Table**
  - **Aggregated Table**

## ⚙️ ETL Pipelines
This project implements robust **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** pipelines to automate data movement and processing:
- Extracting data from **CSV files**.
- Transforming data using **SQL scripts and stored procedures**.
- Loading data into structured tables for efficient querying.

## 🏗 Data Modeling
Developed **fact and dimension tables** optimized for analytical queries, improving **performance and scalability**.

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting
- Created **SQL-based reports and dashboards** to generate actionable insights.
- Enabled **BI & Reporting**, **Ad-Hoc SQL Queries**, and **Machine Learning workflows**.

## 🛠 Error Handling & Optimization
- Implemented **error handling** in ETL processes to ensure data consistency and integrity.
- Optimized queries for **faster performance**.

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated
This project is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:
- **SQL Development**
- **Data Architecture**
- **Data Engineering**
- **ETL Pipeline Development**
- **Data Modeling**
- **Data Analytics**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-warehouse-project.git
   ```
2. **Set Up SQL Server** with the provided scripts.
3. **Run ETL Pipelines** to ingest and process data.
4. **Explore Business Insights** using SQL queries and dashboards.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Automate ETL pipelines using **Apache Airflow**.
- Integrate with **cloud storage solutions**.
